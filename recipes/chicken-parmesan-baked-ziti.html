    <h1>Chicken Parmesan Baked Ziti</h1>
        <img src="../images/chicken-parmesan-baked-ziti/CPBZiti.webp">

        <p>Easy to make, but tasted nothing like Chicken Parm. It was just pasta, pieces of chicken, cheese and pasta sauce. Boring.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 (24 ounce) jars pasta sauce</li>
                <li>4 (8 ounce) packages shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x13-inch baking dishes with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook ziti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>While pasta cooks, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is browned and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine pasta, pasta sauce, and chicken in a large dish. Spread 1/4 of pasta mixture in each 9x13-inch dish. Top each with 2 cups (8 ounces) of mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup Pecorino Romano cheese. Repeat with another layer of pasta and cheeses.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 25 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
